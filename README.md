A small tutorial explores basic concepts related to analyzing audio stimuli and neural responses, relevant to understanding how the brain processes sound. 

## Outline
- Exploring audio stimuli for four categories **bold text**(cat, dog, cow, and rooster).
- Analyzing neural data and visualizing responses to stimuli.
- Comparing neural responses across different stimulus categories.
