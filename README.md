# Programming for neuroscientists (in NEUS620)

A small tutorial exploring basic concepts related to analyzing audio stimuli and neural responses, relevant to understanding how the brain processes sound.

## Outline

This tutorial will cover:

* **Exploring audio stimuli for four categories (cat, dog, cow, and rooster)**. We will load and examine the structure of different audio files.
* **Analyzing neural data and visualizing responses to stimuli**. We'll delve into the `neural_data` dictionary, a key component of our analysis.
* **Comparing neural responses across different stimulus categories**. This will involve using visualization techniques to find meaningful differences.
